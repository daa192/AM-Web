<h4 id="general">GENERAL</h4>

<p>If any part of these Terms of Service are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of this agreement shall continue in effect. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>

<p>If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service then it shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p>The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>

<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Service, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Service, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, at our sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Service will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

<p>Any claim related to this contract or the Service must be brought within one year. The one-year period begins on the date when the claim first could be filed. If it is not, then that claim is permanently barred. This applies to you and you successors. It also applies to us and our successors and assigns.</p>

<p>Neither party shall be responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performing any of its respective obligations under these Terms of Service, except for payment obligations, where and to the extent that such a failure or delay results from causes outside the control of such party. Such causes shall include, without limitation, delays caused by the other party, failures caused by a third-party service, acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the government in its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, freight embargoes, strikes, civil commotion, or the like.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and us regarding the Service and these Terms of Service supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and us regarding the Service.</p>
